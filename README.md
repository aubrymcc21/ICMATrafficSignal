# ICMA Traffic Sign Project
### Developer: Aubry McConnell

### Description:

Upon running, the user will see two buttons labeled "Start" and "Stop," and a traffic light on a road. When the user presses the Start button, the light will turn green, and a car will move across the screen. After 12 seconds the light will turn yellow, then after 5 seconds the light will turn red, then after 10 seconds the light will rotate back to green. The car moves with the light and will disappear from the screen when the light turns red. This light and car animation repeats indefinitely until the Stop button is clicked. When the Stop button is pressed, both the light and the car will stop moving until the Start button is clicked again, at which point the light and the car will resume their animations.

### To run:

To run this project, simply download the .zip folder, unzip it, and open the "index.htm" file. 

### Developer's thoughts

This project was my first experience in building a website completely from scratch. Needless to say it was quite the learning curve! I had to really push myself out of my comfort zone, and I found the challenge of researching and experimenting incredibly rewarding, as each new discovery encouraged me to learn more and add more to the project. While in the learning process, I decided to learn about and implement keyframes animations to add a car that would give a visual indicator of the traffic light timer running. While this was outside of the original project scope, I think it enhanced the user experience, as well as strengthened my knowledge of these frontend languages.

If I had more time on the project, there are some improvements I would have liked to add. The first improvement I want to add would be the start and stop buttons changing color once pressed, so you know which one is currently active. On that same note, I would like to add a timer somewhere on the screen to display how much time is left on the current light color. Polishing the graphics a bit more, perhaps adding a tree or building in the background, and generally detailing the shapes more would add to an overall more enjoyable user experience.
